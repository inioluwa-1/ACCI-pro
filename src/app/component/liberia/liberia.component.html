          At ACCI, we recognize the potential of Liberia’s youth as catalysts for change. Through transformative initiatives like the Community Engagement Exchange (CEE) Workshop and the International Youth Day (IYD) Conference in 2024, we equipped young Liberians with the knowledge, tools, and platforms to lead sustainable development in their communities.
